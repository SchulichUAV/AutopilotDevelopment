# Safety Information

### Plane-Specific Safety Information for Operators and Integrators

- **Takeoff Mode**: Plane takeoff mode differs from copter takeoff. As soon as a plane is put into takeoff mode, it will instantly begin an autonomous takeoff sequence according to parameters set in ArduPilot.
- **Waypoint Navigation**: Plane missions require detailed waypoint planning.
- **Loiter Mode**: In plane mode, loitering causes the vehicle to circle around a set point, following a loiter radius parameter.

### Additional Plane-Specific Considerations (Under Investigation)

- **Autonomous Landings**: Investigating autonomous landing functionality, especially in relation to RTL (Return-to-Launch) mode.
- **Turn Navigation at Waypoints**: Evaluating how the vehicle handles tight turns when navigating through a sequence of waypoints, especially when an immediate turn is required.
